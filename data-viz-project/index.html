    <h1>Child Poverty in Maryland and Baltimore City Neighborhoods</h1>
    <h2>A closer look at how child poverty differs across Maryland</h2>
    <h3>By Eric Neugeboren </h3>
    <p>Child poverty is a key indicator of income inequality. This analysis dives into the child poverty rates across Maryland. Baltimore City has consistently been near the top of child poverty rates among Maryland counties. That held true in 2020, with nearly 27% of Baltimore City children living in poverty. The next analysis looks at the child poverty rate in the Upton/Druid Heights neighborhood in Baltimore. This area had the highest child poverty rate of any Baltimore neighborhood in 2020, and data over time shows how the problem is getting worse. </p>
